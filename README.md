# Social-Network-API

## User Story

AS A social media startup

I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database

SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a social network API

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application

THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the 
MongoDB database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts

THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia

THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database

WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia

THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

## Description
My motivation for this project was to take what I learned from class and apply it in this challenge to make a social network api. This application shows skills in using node.js, javascript, express.js, mongodb, mongoose, etc. Users are able create routes to CRUD information about users, their thoughts, friends and reactions.
